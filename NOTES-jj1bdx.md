## Signal comparison with other receivers

17-NOV-2018

Virtually no big difference between softfm-jj1bdx, SDR-Radio Console,
and a standalone receiver (ONKYO R-801A) connected to the same antenna system
(Nippon Antenna AF-1-SP dipole) at the balcony, ~20km direct view from the
FM transmission sites of Osaka region (Iimori Yama / Ikoma San).

Measured result of no-sound period and 880Hz time report tone of NHK-FM Osaka (88.1MHz):

* Noise level of the no-sound period: ~ -70dBFS +- 1dBFS
* THD+N level of the 880Hz tone: ~ 0.9% (multipath distortion possible) +- 0.1%

The antenna system seems to be the main factor.
